// What is the result?
// A 0, 0, 0
// B 150,60,0
// C Compilation fails
// D 150,150,150
// E An exception thrown at runtime

//Think first about the answer!

//This is D
// so what exactly happening in the code
// RacerCar Object Method speed returns 150, then the next  Car reference variable with RacerCar Object with method speed acces the method of
// RacerCar so one again we get 150, the same happens with a reference of Vehicle it has once again a RacerCar Object, so it must goes as follows
// If you acces a Super reference with Object of Subclass , then the Methods of Subclass would be called first!
